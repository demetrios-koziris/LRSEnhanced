# LRS Enhanced
Chrome extension keyboard shortcuts for the [McGill Lecture Recording System](http://lrs.mcgill.ca). (Also works on myCourses)

>I hate lecture recordings and I definitely hate the McGill lecture recording system, but I **love** keyboard shortcuts. 

\- every McGill student, probably. So I merged them together.

For the most part the standard YouTube keyboard shortcuts are used.
